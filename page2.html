            <h3>A Life Contract is Made</h3>
            <p>...full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil
                was sitting on the live coals.  Are you sitting upon a treasure,
                said the peasant.  Yes, in truth, replied the devil, on a treasure
                which contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in
                your life.  The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me, said
                the peasant.  It is yours, answered the devil, if you will for
                two years give me one half of everything your field produces.
                Money I have enough, but I have a desire for the fruits of the
                earth.  The peasant agreed to the bargain.  In order, however,
                that no dispute may arise about the division, said he, everything
                that is above ground shall belong to you, and what is under the
                earth to me.  The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the
                cunning peasant had sown turnips.
