            <h3>Cheating the Devil</h3>
            <p>Now when the time for harvest came, the devil appeared and
                wanted to take away his crop.  But he found nothing but the
                yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight,
                was digging up his turnips.  You have had the best of it for once,
                said the devil, but the next time that won't do.  What grows
                above ground shall be yours, and what is under it, mine.  I am
                willing, replied the peasant.  But when the time came to sow, he
                did not again sow turnips, but wheat.  The grain became ripe,
                and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks
                down to the ground.  When the devil came, he found nothing but
                the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the
                rocks.  That is the way to cheat the devil, said the
                peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure.
